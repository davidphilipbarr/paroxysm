# Paroxysm

Paroxysm is an attempt at a less opinionated ergo board with column stagger, pinky and ring splay and 'inverted thumbs'.

It can be used wireless with a nice!nano (it accommodates a power switch and battery connectivity) or with a promicro or cheaper controller as a wired keyboard.

It might not be your favourite board but it might be a cheapish way to try out some stuff listed above.

It uses the cradio firmware for zmk or qmk.

You can more or less use the sweep build guides.
